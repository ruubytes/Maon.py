Maon is a hobby project, a highly personalized discord bot, and a project to get to know the Git workflow.
Maon is written in **Python3.9+** and tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 Server / WSL Ubuntu 22**, but should run on most UNIX platforms, if you can install the required libraries below.

### üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Moderators

```
remove, clear, delete <1 - 75>
        Deletes a number of messages from the channel.

### üé∂ Music

```
p, play, yt, stream <link / path>
        Maon will join and play a Youtube link or a local file
        from the music or sfx folder.
        If Maon is already in the voice channel, or has
        recognized the bot channel after having been summoned
        more than 2 times, the command is no longer necessary.
        A youtube link or file path alone will suffice to play
        it.

s, sfx, sound, effect <path>
        Play a sound effect from the sfx folder.
        If Maon is already in the voice channel, or has
        recognized the bot channel after having been summoned
        more than 3 times, the command is no longer necessary.
        The name of the sound effect alone will suffice to play
        it.

j, join
        Maon will join the voice channel.

stop, exit, quit, leave
        Maon will stop playing audio and leave the voice

        latency.

## Installation:

### Discord Tokens & IDs:

Maon needs a **discord API token**, your **discord ID**, and some **intents** enabled.

### Linux:

Required packages for maon to function are `python3-pip`, `ffmpeg` and `opus-tools`. These can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip ffmpeg opus-tools -y

Next, simply execute the `run` script in the main directory of Maon and let it install the required python dependencies.
Afterwards, Maon will ask for the **discord API token** and your **discord ID**.

Additional run arguments are `./run noupdate` to skip the update check, and `./run setup` to re-setup the **discord API token** and **discord ID**.

My preferred way to run Maon is with a terminal multiplexer like tmux:

    tmux new -d -s "maon" /home/user/Maon.py/run

## Troubleshooting:

- ClientException when trying to play audio.

ffmpeg needs to be in the system path, because the audio_player creates a subprocess with ffmpeg to stream audio.
